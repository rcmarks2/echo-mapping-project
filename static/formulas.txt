ECHO GLOBAL LOGISTICS - ROUTE CALCULATION FORMULAS

DIESEL TRUCK FORMULAS

1. Fuel Cost:
   = (Annual Trips) × (Miles per Trip ÷ MPG) × $3.59 (Average US Diesel Price)

2. Maintenance Cost:
   = Miles per Trip × (17,500 ÷ Annual Mileage)

3. Depreciation Cost:
   = Total Annual Miles × (166,000 ÷ 750,000)

4. Labor Cost:
   = (Miles per Trip ÷ 50 mph) × (Hourly Rate based on $75,000 annual salary)

5. Total Annual Cost:
   = Fuel + Maintenance + Depreciation + Labor

6. CO₂ Emissions:
   = Total Annual Miles × 1.617 kg/mile → Convert to metric tons (÷ 1000)


ELECTRIC TRUCK FORMULAS

1. Fuel Cost:
   = (Total Trip Miles ÷ 20.39) × $2.208 (Converted Battery Charge Price)

2. Maintenance Cost:
   = Miles per Trip × (10,500 ÷ Annual Mileage)

3. Depreciation Cost:
   = Total Annual Miles × (250,000 ÷ 750,000)

4. Labor Cost:
   = (Miles per Trip ÷ 50 mph) × (Hourly Rate based on $75,000 annual salary)

5. Total Annual Cost:
   = Fuel + Maintenance + Depreciation + Labor

6. CO₂ Emissions:
   = Total Annual Miles × 0.2102 kg/mile → Convert to metric tons (÷ 1000)
