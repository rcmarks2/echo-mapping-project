ECHO GLOBAL LOGISTICS - ROUTE CALCULATION FORMULAS

DIESEL TRUCK FORMULAS

1. Fuel Cost:
   = (Annual Trips) × (Miles per Trip ÷ MPG) × $3.59

2. Maintenance Cost:
   = (One Trip Miles) × (17,500 ÷ Annual Mileage)

3. Depreciation Cost:
   = (One Trip Miles) × ($16,600 ÷ 750,000)

4. Total Annual Cost:
   = Fuel Cost + Maintenance Cost + Depreciation Cost

5. Annual CO₂ Emissions:
   = Annual Mileage × 1.617 (kg CO₂/mile) → divide by 1000 to get metric tons


ELECTRIC TRUCK FORMULAS

1. Battery Charge Cost:
   = (Total Miles ÷ 20.39) × $2.208

2. Maintenance Cost:
   = (One Trip Miles) × (10,500 ÷ Annual Mileage)

3. Depreciation Cost:
   = (Annual Miles) × ($250,000 ÷ 750,000)

4. Total Annual Cost:
   = Charge Cost + Maintenance Cost + Depreciation Cost

5. Annual CO₂ Emissions:
   = Annual Mileage × 0.2102 (kg CO₂/mile) → divide by 1000 to get metric tons
