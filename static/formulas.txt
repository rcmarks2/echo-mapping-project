ECHO GLOBAL LOGISTICS - ROUTE CALCULATION FORMULAS

DIESEL TRUCK FORMULAS

1. Fuel Cost:
   = (Annual Trips) × (Miles per Trip ÷ MPG) × $3.59 (Average US Diesel Price)

2. Maintenance Cost:
   = (One Trip Miles) × [17,500 (Average Yearly Truck Maintenance Cost) ÷ 62,169 (Average Number Miles a Truck Covers in a Year)]

3. Depreciation Cost:
   = (One Trip Miles) × [$166,000 (Average Truck Purchase Cost) ÷ 750,000 (Average Lifetime Miles for a Truck)]

4. Labor Cost:
   = (Miles per Trip ÷ 50 mph) × [75,000 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 6 days ÷ 8 hours] × Annual Trips

   - Labor is based on an average truck speed of 50 mph.
   - Hourly rate is calculated from a $75,000/year salary over 52 weeks, 6 working days per week, and 8 hours per day.
   - Resulting hourly rate = $30.04/hour.

4. Total Annual Cost:
   = Fuel Cost + Maintenance Cost + Depreciation Cost + Labor Cost

5. Annual CO₂ Emissions:
   = Annual Mileage × 1.617 (kg CO₂/mile) → divide by 1000 to get metric tons


ELECTRIC TRUCK FORMULAS

1. Fuel Cost:
   = (Annual Trips) × (Miles per Trip ÷ MPG) × $3.59 (Average US Diesel Price)

2. Maintenance Cost:
   = (One Trip Miles) × [10,500 (Average Yearly Truck Maintenance Cost) ÷ 62,169 (Average Number Miles a Truck Covers in a Year)]

3. Depreciation Cost:
   = (One Trip Miles) × [$250,000 (Average Truck Purchase Cost) ÷ 750,000 (Average Lifetime Miles for a Truck)]

4. Labor Cost:
   = (Miles per Trip ÷ 50 mph) × [75,000 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 6 days ÷ 8 hours] × Annual Trips

   - Labor is based on an average truck speed of 50 mph.
   - Hourly rate is calculated from a $75,000/year salary over 52 weeks, 6 working days per week, and 8 hours per day.
   - Resulting hourly rate = $30.04/hour.

4. Total Annual Cost:
   = Charge Cost + Maintenance Cost + Depreciation Cost + Labor Cost

5. Annual CO₂ Emissions:
   = Annual Mileage × 0.2102 (kg CO₂/mile) → divide by 1000 to get metric tons
